# Ruby on Rails Book Review Application

## Getting started

Clone the repo and install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```

```

If the test suite passes, run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
